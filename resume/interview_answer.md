It's a great company, stable daily work, good communications between employees, using data-driven to do things. If I'm more than 32, I definitly stay.

##### The reason i leave Gamesofa Inc. without find a job first?
First few years of work experiences is the most important time of all life career. I make a check point two years after I had been Gamesofa Inc. 3 months and it's too comfortable to leave. So, I quited first and think about what i should do next. After that, i decided to focus on back-end and infrastructure and follow open source or tweet of top engineers in the world.
