### picking reason
I applied booking.com  because I like to travel, I had two experience of long period of time. 5 years ago in United State and Japan , and another in past 4 months in Europe. And there are some coincidences , younger schoolmate told me that she had a interview with booking.com and another is I found a exam on HackerRank.



As a software engineer , I code several languages, start with web technology php , js and extend to others python perl c++ golang bash.


I start with my first commercial company, gamesofa. It's online poker game company using web technology to interact with people. In that compnay , I used html5 on win8 app (big two) . It's a client project , just like android or ios. 


After this project , I was pulled out by marketing reason to backend team which mostly use PHP, Perl as developing languages. Daily life in this role is discuss with PM , make schedule decisions, integrate with client  , build game activities page to show user status in this event.  Most people I contact are project manager , designer , and Quality Assurance.


// db 
After angularJs library launched, I used it in some management pages. It's quite convenient to render form-liked page, something like showing datas. 

By the way , the company use mysql as database. all server engineer will desing database schema.


I also stayed in marketing department for one year . I did data modeling , data virtualization to help analyst analying what out targets are. That's pretty matched with some articles talking about expepiment , a/b testing on booking.com blog.

In one day afternoon , we had a break together , assistant took a picture and comment on it.
She never saw a group men smile around a man.
I think it's a joke at that time.
But if I use it to describe my personality or collaborative relationship , I think it's appropriated.
