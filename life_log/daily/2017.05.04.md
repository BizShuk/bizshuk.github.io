First scrum daily standup. There are a lot of people in there. But it should be a quick meeting. So, you won't be talking details in this kind of meeting.
Just answer what you did , what you will do , and anything block you. Enan will lead the meeting flow. Follow her lead , it'll be more easy to go throught whole meeting. 

Subba also said that if you get things to do , meet your family , or emergency , you can send an email or let someone to update your status. Don't worry about meeting time in the evening break any appointment.

Btw, Iris is in leave ,but she still joined standup meeting today. She is the one have the best communicating skill in english. That's no doubt.
