# Lean Start Up

### 4 Experiment

##### Break It Down
- Value hypothesis
- Growth hypothesis

### innovation accounting
### learning milestone



- vanity metrics
- actionable metrics


### Genchi Gembutsu
go and see for yourself


### Minimum viable product

- Dropbox, a simple video exmplaning efforts of sychronization of files.
- Concierge, providing services in person and implement the valuable part of processes instead of building services and validate them.
- Aardvark, answering question which is not factual queries by building series of functioning products to validate or refute the hypothesis.



### Measure
- Supply-side incrsing returns
- Demand-side incresing returns

1. Establish baseline
2. Turning the engine
3. Pivot or Persevere


##### Optimization Versus Learning


##### Vanity metrics vs Actionable metrics


##### age-old startup problem
How do web know which features to prioritize?
How can we get more customers to sign up and pay?
How can we get out the word about our product?

=> How confident are you that you are making the right decisions in terms of establishing priorities?


###### Great bargain of agile development
Engineers agree to adapt the prodcuut to the business's constantly changin requirements but are not responsible for the quality of those business decisions.


##### cause and effect

##### A/B testing
market-specific or direct marketing-specific


##### Kanban


##### The value of Threee 'A's
- Actionable
- Accessible
- Auditable

##### summary
Have to know what is the most difficult, the omst time-consuming, and the biggest source of waste and know how to pivot and persevere.




### Pivot (*)
There is no way to remove the human element --- vision, intuition, judgement.

##### Zoom-in Pivot



### Accelerate

##### Batch (*)
- one envalope at a time **Single-piece flow** vs fold all letter, stamp, and then seal.

    => one envalope at a time win. 

**SMED, Single-Minute Exchange of Die** [wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Single-minute_exchange_of_die)

once there is a defect in one flow and it can't be fixed in short time. Stop the whole production line.

##### SEC-regulated environment
?



##### large-batch death spiral
large batch works result in additional work, rework, delays, and interruptions. Everyone hsa an incentive to do work in ever-large batch.

For software company, there is no physical limits. So it keeps growing and becomes highest-priority project called `bet the company`.



##### PUll, Don't Push
To prevent stockout and big warehouse, when one is used, it will create a hole. The hole is a signal to pull new one to this center. It becomes a series of pull chain.

Just-in-case inventory called work-in progress (WIP) inventory.
Most of business  plans are WIP.




### Growth of Engine
viral
paid engine of growth => gain revenue of existing customers or drive down cost of acquiring a new customer.

make sure the strategy whether it is for viral or paid engine.

for example: fb should go viral, 


### Adapt
- Freindster effect
- Five WHYs , ask WHY five times, how to avoid to become Five Blaims?
    + people affected by the problem
    + anyone discover and disnosed the problem
    + include customer represtatives
    + who tries to fix the symptoms and people involved in subsystem and features
    + decision makers



### Inovate

- scarce but secure resources
- independent authority to develop their business
- personal stake in the outcome
