Today, I met with Iris. I asked her for helping to advise me on Toefl Speaking test. Somehow, the way is totally different from the cramming school's way. Iris's way is more like that descibing things or reasons in abstract level without examples. However, this way is required abundant vocabularies, like aboriginal(Indigenous), or specific story about John Hopkins who is a scientist and developed black hole theory. This way to answer the speaking test question is that I would like to archieve, but it takes times. For now, first things I need to do is to pass the exam. Therefore, I should follow simple and concise instructions to reach the standard of University admission.

Afterward, I went home and wrote this note. And Iris have an appointment with her best friend. Iris still went back to her home, because the appintment schedule is at 8pm. Her friend don't want to come out before that. I invited Iris to look for her new sandals togerther in Gongguan. But she gave a soft rejection due to her surgery wound and uncertain weather conditon.

That's it today. I also see a big gap between us.
